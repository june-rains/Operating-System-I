1. The CPU utilization is 100%, because the calling 2 process are both using CPU, not issues I/O requests
the results you can run the command ./process.py -l 5:100,5:100 -c -p to see

2. Total time is 11 units, in the initial state, the process0 is in running state, and process1 is in ready state,
when the process0 finished,(4 units after), the process1 start running, when issues 1 I/O requests(it will use 1 unit time CPU),
the IO will be busy, and CPU will idle, after IO done(5 units after), it will run the CPU to show IO is done 

3. Total time will change, also the CPU utlization and IO utilization will change accordingly, see the results yourself

4. The results will be the same as the second one

5. The results will be the same as the third one

6/7/8. The results you can run by yourself, and you should analysis the results yourself
